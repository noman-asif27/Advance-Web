        Lahor has a very old history. Outside Lahor, there are some high mounds
        which likely contain ancient sites. Historians believe that a town
        called Śalātura existed in the vicinity, where the Sanskrit grammarian
        Panini probably lived. The Chinese traveller Huan Tsang visited the city
        in the 7th century AD and reported that there was said to have been a
        statue for Panini in the town (but not present in his time). Although
        it is known that Panini (c. 450 - 350 BCE) was born in Śalātura, a small
        town near Attock on the northwestern Indian peninsula in what is now
        Pakistan, historians remain uncertain as to the exact dates of Panini's
        birth and death. One theory, supported by internal references that
        indicate Panini had contact with or was at least aware of Greek
        civilization, place his life after the year 327 BCE, when Macedonian
        Alexander the Great reached northwestern India. However, historical
        evidence supports limited contact between the two civilizations as early
        as the sixth century BCE.[1] Alexander the Great is said to have passed
        through the area, in trying to cross the Indus River through the Hund.
        He is also said to have faced significant resistance from the people of
        Lahor. The oldest Lahor port located in Mohallah Ghari Khankhail (GKK)
        shows Lahor being among Alexander's possessions.

        Lāhor (لاهور), also known as Little Lahore (Pashto: وړوکی لاهور, Urdu:
        چھوٹا لاہور), previously known as Salatura (سلاطوره), is a town within
        the Swabi District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The town serves as
        the headquarters of the Lahor Tehsil and is administratively subdivided
        into two union councils.[1] The town is a settlement of 35,000 people
        and is located at 34°02′54″N 72°21′56″E with an altitude of 308
        metres[2] and lies west of Swabi and on the northern bank of the Indus
        River (locally known as Abasin). In the vicinity of Lahor are Panjpir,
        Hund and Zaida three other cities of the ancient world. Administration
